/*Here we'll take an array (count) which will loop over the array trust. 
Arraty count will keep a track of how many people each person trusts (decrementing the count)  and how many people each person doesn't trust (Incrementing the count). Hence, a person whose count value is n-1 is the one amongst the n people who did not trust any one and was trusted by every one.*/
