/* Problem: Given a string, return the index of first non repeating character 
Approach: Here, we will use HashMap. We will traverse through the string and start storing it's characters 
as keys in HashMap with corresponding value as 1. If any characer is repeated, we will not store the characted twice, 
instead we will increment it's value by 1(So, basically, we will store the letters and their frequency in the hashmap).
Then we will iterate again through the string and return the index of the first value whose frequency is 1.

class Solution {
    public int firstUniqChar(String s) {
        
        HashMap<Character,Integer> res = new HashMap<Character, Integer>();
        
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
        {
            char c=s.charAt(i);
                if(res.containsKey(c))
                {
                    res.put(c,res.get(c)+1);
                }
            else
            {
                res.put(c,1);
            }
        }
        
        for(int i=0;i<s.length();i++)
        {
            char c=s.charAt(i);
            if(res.get(c)==1)
                return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
